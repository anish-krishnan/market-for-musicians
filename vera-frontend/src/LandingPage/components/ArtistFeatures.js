            Vera allows you to unlock a new stream of crowd-funded revenue by
            tapping into your fanbase for trusted investment. By distributing
            assets such as music and special content to the public, you can
            provide an unparalleled level of interaction with your fans while
            bringing in a new source of income to keep the music flowing.

            Our goal at Vera is to preserve your creative freedom while creating
            new opportunities using our crowd funding model. You retain all
            ownership and copyright over your original work, while your fans
            gain ownership of a limited edition DLV of your music. We want you
            to keep making music that we all love, and we’re here to support you
            along the way.

            Once you have a song on a streaming service such as Spotify,
            creating a Vera DLV is as simple as clicking a button. You’ll simply
            connect your account and enter in information about the piece that
            will add to the creative value of the DLV! Vera will automatically
            set up an initial DLV auction for your followers and fans on the
            site.

            You have the flexibility to set monetization rates on sales of your
            digital vinyl records! You make both a large percentage of initial
            record auction sales, plus a small commission on all future
            transactions of your records on the Vera public market.
