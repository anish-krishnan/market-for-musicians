This gives the original painting and its owner incredible value due to its rarity. Non-Fungible Tokens do this for digital creations like art, games, and in our case, music."

This is possible because NFTs are unique and certified digital assets stored on the blockchain. While copies of digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs track and provide you with proof of ownership over a digital asset."
