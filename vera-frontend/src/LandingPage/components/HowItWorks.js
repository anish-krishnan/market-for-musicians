This gives the original painting and its owner incredible value due to its rarity. Digital Vinyl Records do this for digital creations like art, games, and in our case, music."

This is possible because digital records are unique and certified digital assets stored on the blockchain. While copies of digital music are available for anyone to obtain, Vera’s digital vinyl records track and provide you with proof of ownership over a digital asset."
